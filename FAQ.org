* How do you handle Service Discovery and Locality?

[ Reference: http://mesos.apache.org/documentation/latest/app-framework-development-guide/ ]

Use the DiscoveryInfo message for declaring the visibility and discovery options.

#+BEGIN_SRC protobuf
message DiscoveryInfo {
  enum Visibility {
    FRAMEWORK = 0;
    CLUSTER = 1;
    EXTERNAL = 2;
  }

  required Visibility visibility = 1;
  optional string name = 2;
  optional string environment = 3;
  optional string location = 4;
  optional string version = 5;
  optional Ports ports = 6;
  optional Labels labels = 7;
}

* What do you think of Mesomatic?

- We absolutely loved the presentation given by Pierre at EuroClojure https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-fVA5DxezE
- It is clearly more mature than clj-mesos at this point but we'd already started building our workshop around clj-mesos.

(Perhaps we can provide a sample for users)
