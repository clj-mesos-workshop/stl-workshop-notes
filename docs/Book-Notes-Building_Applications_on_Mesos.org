* Chapter 1 - Introduction to Mesos

Mesos is a system that allows you to harness all of the different machines in your
computer cluster or data center and treat them as a single logical entity.

With Mesos, the problem of having fixed sets of machines assigned to applications
is no longer an issue. Instead, you can easily change which software is running on
which machines, or even abdicate the responsibility of choosing which software runs
on which machines to Mesos and allow Mesos to make that decision for you.

In practice, itâ€™s best to think of Mesos as serving a different purpose altogether. It
allows you to stop focusing on individual machines, whether for developing your
applications or for deploying them. Instead, it allows you to treat your cluster as a
single, large group of resources.

- Companies use Mesos because of the reliability, flexibility and efficiency it brings.

- Mesos brokers divisions of machines between many Frameworks.

** On Frameworks

- Frameworks can act as applications, like Hadoop or Storm.
- Frameworks can act as deployment systems, like Ansible, Chef.
- Mesos coordinates and collaborates with Frameworks to allocate slices of machines
  in the Mesos cluster towards various roles.

** Mesos as Deployment System

- Traditional tools like Chef, Ansible, Puppet aren't adequate for dynamically
  changing configurations, depending on external factors.
- You would still need a traditional configuration manager to bootstrap a Mesos cluster

** Mesos as an Execution Plaform

- Rather than paying for 3rd party PaaS solutions like Heroku, you can have single Mesos cluster.
